# INTRANETS
An intranet is a private network within an organization used to securely share information and resources among employees. It enhances communication, collaboration, and access to important company data. Intranets also offer personalized content, project management tools, and social features, improving organizational efficiency. However, challenges include user participation, support issues, and managing remote access.

Confluence centralizes all technical documentation, making it easy for teams to collaborate, track changes, and reuse content. It supports various document types, from specs to user guides, and allows publishing in multiple formats. With draw.io integration, teams can also create and update diagrams directly within Confluence.
